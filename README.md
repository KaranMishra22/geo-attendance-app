# Geo-Attendance – Location-Based Attendance System 📍

A mobile application built using **Flutter** that allows employees or students to mark their attendance based on live geolocation. The system uses **geo-fencing** to validate presence within approved boundaries, eliminating proxy attendance and enhancing institutional transparency.

> 🚫 **Note**: This repository currently showcases the design and workflow of the app through screenshots. The source code is unavailable due to system reset and archival loss. A minimal rebuilt version may be added later.
